## Summary
> Only computer hackers who have delved into the inconvenient guts of
> an operating system that turns their home computer into a giant pile
> of tinker-toys are truly liberated from the cruel manipulation of their
> slipshod corporate taskmasters. You know what I think makes an operating
> system truly great? Its ability to help me GET MY WORK DONE.
